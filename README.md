## Project Overview
ChurnNet is a predictive analytics tool designed to determine whether a customer is likely to stay with or leave a bank. This Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model utilizes historical customer data to predict churn, allowing businesses to take proactive steps to retain valuable clients. The flexibility of this model means it can be adapted to different datasets, making it a practical solution across various industries.

## Problem Solved
In the banking sector, understanding customer behavior is critical for retention strategies. Losing customers (churn) can significantly impact revenue and growth. Traditional methods of identifying churn are often reactive and inefficient. ChurnNet solves this by predicting churn before it happens, giving banks the actionable insights needed to intervene and improve customer satisfaction.

## Key Features
- **Predictive Accuracy:** Uses advanced ANN to deliver high-accuracy predictions of customer churn.
- **Scalable:** The model can be adapted to different datasets, making it versatile across various business contexts.
- **Real-time Insights:** Provides timely predictions to allow for proactive customer retention strategies.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## How It Works

### Data Preparation
Customer data, including demographics, transaction history, and engagement metrics, is loaded and explored to understand the structure of the dataset.

### Data Preprocessing
The data is cleaned and transformed, including converting categorical variables to numerical values using one-hot encoding.

### Model Training
The ANN is trained on the preprocessed dataset. The training process involves multiple epochs, with the model improving its accuracy over time.

### Prediction
Once trained, the model can predict whether a customer will stay or leave based on new data.

## Use Cases
- **Customer Retention Strategies:** Banks can use ChurnNet to identify at-risk customers and implement retention strategies.
- **Personalized Marketing:** Tailor marketing efforts to retain high-value customers predicted to churn.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Allocate resources more effectively by focusing on customers with a higher risk of leaving.

## Installation & Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/churnnet.git`
2. **Install Dependencies:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the Model:** Use the provided Jupyter Notebook to load data, preprocess it, and train the model.
4. **Predict Churn:** Input new customer data into the trained model to get churn predictions.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the model or adapting it for new use cases, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Please see the contributing guidelines for more details.

## Models Used
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN):** A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on customer data to predict churn.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** Used for building and training the ANN model.

## Interesting Tidbit: Feature Scaling and Baking
Imagine you're baking a cake, and the recipe calls for both sugar and salt, but in very different quantitiesâ€”say, a cup of sugar and just a pinch of salt. If you were to measure everything in cups, your cake might be way too salty because the pinch of salt wouldn't be measured accurately. 

In the same way, when training a machine learning model like ChurnNet, features (or ingredients) like account balance and age can have very different ranges. Feature scaling adjusts these ranges so that each feature contributes fairly to the model's training process. Just like how proper measuring ensures your cake turns out delicious, feature scaling ensures your model's predictions are accurate.
